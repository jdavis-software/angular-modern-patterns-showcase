# 🚀 Angular Modern Patterns Showcase

A comprehensive demonstration of cutting-edge Angular patterns and best practices for 2025! This repository showcases the latest Angular features including Signals, NgRx integration, RxJS patterns, Web Components, performance optimizations, and accessibility implementations.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This showcase demonstrates real-world implementations of modern Angular patterns that every developer should know. Each section is interactive and includes detailed explanations of the underlying concepts.

### 🎯 Signals Demo: Fine-grained Local Reactivity
**Location:** `src/components/signals-demo.component.ts`

Experience Angular's revolutionary Signals API in action! This interactive shopping cart demonstrates:

- ✨ **WritableSignal** - Reactive state management without RxJS
- 🧮 **Computed Signals** - Automatic derived state calculations
- 🔄 **Effects** - Side effects that respond to signal changes
- 📊 **Real-time Updates** - Watch totals, discounts, and counts update instantly

**Key Patterns:**
```typescript
// Writable signals for state
cartItems = signal<CartItem[]>([]);

// Computed signals for derived state
totalPrice = computed(() => 
  this.cartItems().reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0)
);

// Effects for side effects
effect(() => console.log('Cart updated:', this.cartItems()));
```
